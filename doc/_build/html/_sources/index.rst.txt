Welcome to rootplots's documentation!
=====================================

This package was inspired by ROOT Project's histogramming library. It has no connection to ROOT and such it doesn't require ROOT, PyROOT, nor ROOTPy. Its also not compatible with ROOT's libraries.

This package is structured in 3 modules: a module for histograms, another for profile histograms and another for drawing/painting.
