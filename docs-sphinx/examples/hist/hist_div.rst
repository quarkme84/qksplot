How to Divide histograms
===========================

This example shows how to divide 2 histograms. To show the effect of dividing 2 histograms we use `matplotlib` to create a 2 by 2 grid to display multiple plots on the same window. The histograms are plotted using the plotting module `mpl` from this package (which internally uses matplotlib).
