The Plotting Module
===================

This module makes convenient to easy and quickly plot Histograms and Profiles. It is not meant to contain all
imaginable functionality for plotting but only provides a quick way.

In case you require more plotting functionality you might find useful the source code of this module, which
internally it uses using the popular Matplotlib to do the actual plotting. Also, the examples from Histogram
and Profile modules show how to use this plotting module or even, how to mix it with matplotlib.
